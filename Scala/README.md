# Scala Programming - DSA Contributions

Welcome to the Scala folder for DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) contributions!

## Structure

Organize your code by topic:
- `arrays/` - Array-related problems
- `linked_lists/` - Linked list implementations and problems
- `stacks/` - Stack implementations and problems
- `queues/` - Queue implementations and problems
- `trees/` - Tree data structures and algorithms
- `graphs/` - Graph algorithms
- `sorting/` - Sorting algorithms
- `searching/` - Searching algorithms
- `dynamic_programming/` - DP problems
- `greedy/` - Greedy algorithms
- `backtracking/` - Backtracking problems
- `math/` - Mathematical algorithms
- `strings/` - String manipulation problems

## Naming Convention

- Use PascalCase for object/class files: `BinarySearch.scala`, `BubbleSort.scala`
- Include problem name in filename if solving a specific problem

## Code Guidelines

- Add Scaladoc comments explaining the algorithm
- Include time and space complexity in comments
- Provide example usage in main method
- Follow Scala style guide
- Use functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Leverage Scala collections library
