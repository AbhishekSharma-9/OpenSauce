# C++ Programming - DSA Contributions

Welcome to the C++ folder for DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) contributions!

## Structure

Organize your code by topic:
- `arrays/` - Array-related problems
- `linked_lists/` - Linked list implementations and problems
- `stacks/` - Stack implementations and problems
- `queues/` - Queue implementations and problems
- `trees/` - Tree data structures and algorithms
- `graphs/` - Graph algorithms
- `sorting/` - Sorting algorithms
- `searching/` - Searching algorithms
- `dynamic_programming/` - DP problems
- `greedy/` - Greedy algorithms
- `backtracking/` - Backtracking problems
- `math/` - Mathematical algorithms
- `strings/` - String manipulation problems
- `tries` - tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings
- 

## Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `binary_search.cpp`, `bubble_sort.cpp`
- Include problem name in filename if solving a specific problem

## Code Guidelines

- Add comments explaining the algorithm
- Include time and space complexity in comments
- Provide example usage in comments or main function
- Follow standard C++ coding conventions (prefer C++11 or later features)
- Use STL where appropriate
